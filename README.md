# Solar System Visualizer

This project is an interactive web-based application that lets users explore a 3D solar system and view a collection of stunning astronomical images. The project features:

1. **Landing Page**: The homepage that directs users to the animation or gallery page.
2. **Solar System Animation**: A 3D interactive solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), where users can observe the planets revolving around the Sun.
3. **Gallery Page**: A collection of breathtaking astronomical images fetched from NASAâ€™s API, giving users a closer look at the cosmos.

## Features

- **3D Solar System Animation**: The solar system animation is built with Three.js to create an interactive experience where the planets revolve around the Sun in a realistic 3D simulation.
- **Astronomical Image Gallery**: The gallery showcases high-quality astronomical images fetched dynamically from NASA's API, providing an immersive view of space exploration.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The landing page and other sections are designed for a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality, including the logic for the solar system animation and the dynamic fetching of NASA images.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library used to create the 3D solar system animation.
- **NASA API**: Used to fetch real-time astronomical images for the gallery page.

## Features Breakdown

### 1. **Solar System Animation (3D)**
   - **Three.js**: The solar system animation is created using Three.js, a powerful library for 3D graphics. It allows users to see the planets revolving around the Sun with realistic physics and animation effects.
   - **Planetary Movement**: Planets rotate on their respective orbits and spin around their axes, mimicking real-life solar system behavior.
   - **Interactive Controls**: The animation is interactive, allowing users to rotate the scene and zoom in/out using mouse controls.

### 2. **Astronomical Image Gallery**
   - **NASA API**: The gallery page fetches images from NASA's API to showcase high-resolution space imagery. These images are dynamically loaded and displayed on the gallery page.
   - **Images & Descriptions**: Each image includes a description of the astronomical body or event being displayed, adding educational value for the user.
